# yolo-custom-segmentation
PyTorch-based reimplementation of the YOLO instance segmentation model featuring a full architecture replication of Ultralytics with advanced enhancements. The model integrates C3k nested blocks, C2PSA attention modules, DFL-based bounding box refinement, and depthwise separable convolutions for efficient multi-scale detection and segmentation.
